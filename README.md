🤖 Fetch JIRA Issues and Build Test Cases using AI



An AI-powered automation workflow built using \*\*n8n\*\*, \*\*Jira REST API\*\*, and \*\*Generative AI\*\* to automatically fetch Jira issues and generate comprehensive software test cases.







📖 Overview



This project automates one of the most time-consuming activities in software testing—creating test cases from Jira requirements.



The workflow retrieves Jira issues using the Jira REST API, sends the issue details to a Generative AI model, and produces structured, reusable, and comprehensive test cases. This significantly reduces manual effort, improves consistency, and accelerates the QA process.





🎯 Objectives



\* Automate retrieval of Jira issues

\* Generate detailed AI-powered test cases

\* Reduce manual test design effort

\* Improve QA productivity

\* Demonstrate AI-driven software testing







✨ Features



\* Fetch Jira Stories, Tasks, and Bugs

\* AI-generated functional test cases

\* AI-generated positive and negative scenarios

\* Boundary value and validation scenarios

\* Preconditions and expected results generation

\* Structured output for QA teams

\* Low-code workflow automation using n8n

\* Easy integration with enterprise Jira instances

🚀 How It Works



1\. User starts the workflow.

2\. n8n authenticates with Jira.

3\. Jira issue details are retrieved.

4\. Issue summary and description are sent to the AI model.

5\. AI analyzes the requirement.

6\. Comprehensive test cases are generated.

7\. Generated output is displayed or exported for QA use.
